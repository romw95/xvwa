1	CVE-2017-7494	94		Exec Code	2017-05-30	2018-10-21	10.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Samba since version 3.5.0 and before 4.6.4, 4.5.10 and 4.4.14 is vulnerable to remote code execution vulnerability, allowing a malicious client to upload a shared library to a writable share, and then cause the server to load and execute it.
2	CVE-2017-14746	416		Exec Code	2017-11-27	2018-10-21	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	Use-after-free vulnerability in Samba 4.x before 4.7.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted SMB1 request.
3	CVE-2016-2119	284		Bypass	2016-07-07	2018-10-21	6.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	libcli/smb/smbXcli_base.c in Samba 4.x before 4.2.14, 4.3.x before 4.3.11, and 4.4.x before 4.4.5 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass a client-signing protection mechanism, and consequently spoof SMB2 and SMB3 servers, via the (1) SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_GUEST or (2) SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_NULL flag.
4	CVE-2017-11103	345			2017-07-13	2017-11-13	6.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with Orpheus' Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a way that violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.
5	CVE-2016-2123	119		Overflow Mem. Corr.	2018-11-01	2019-10-09	6.5	None	Remote	Low	Single system	Partial	Partial	Partial	A flaw was found in samba versions 4.0.0 to 4.5.2. The Samba routine ndr_pull_dnsp_name contains an integer wrap problem, leading to an attacker-controlled memory overwrite. ndr_pull_dnsp_name parses data from the Samba Active Directory ldb database. Any user who can write to the dnsRecord attribute over LDAP can trigger this memory corruption. By default, all authenticated LDAP users can write to the dnsRecord attribute on new DNS objects. This makes the defect a remote privilege escalation.
6	CVE-2018-1057	732			2018-03-13	2019-10-02	6.5	None	Remote	Low	Single system	Partial	Partial	Partial	On a Samba 4 AD DC the LDAP server in all versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards incorrectly validates permissions to modify passwords over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change any other users' passwords, including administrative users and privileged service accounts (eg Domain Controllers).
7	CVE-2018-10858	119		Exec Code Overflow	2018-08-22	2019-06-26	6.5	None	Remote	Low	Single system	Partial	Partial	Partial	A heap-buffer overflow was found in the way samba clients processed extra long filename in a directory listing. A malicious samba server could use this flaw to cause arbitrary code execution on a samba client. Samba versions before 4.6.16, 4.7.9 and 4.8.4 are vulnerable.
8	CVE-2017-12150				2018-07-26	2019-10-09	5.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	None	It was found that samba before 4.4.16, 4.5.x before 4.5.14, and 4.6.x before 4.6.8 did not enforce "SMB signing" when certain configuration options were enabled. A remote attacker could launch a man-in-the-middle attack and retrieve information in plain-text.
9	CVE-2017-12151	310			2018-07-27	2019-10-09	5.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	None	A flaw was found in the way samba client before samba 4.4.16, samba 4.5.14 and samba 4.6.8 used encryption with the max protocol set as SMB3. The connection could lose the requirement for signing and encrypting to any DFS redirects, allowing an attacker to read or alter the contents of the connection via a man-in-the-middle attack.
10	CVE-2019-3880	22		Dir. Trav.	2019-04-09	2019-05-27	5.5	None	Remote	Low	Single system	None	Partial	Partial	A flaw was found in the way samba implemented an RPC endpoint emulating the Windows registry service API. An unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to create a new registry hive file anywhere they have unix permissions which could lead to creation of a new file in the Samba share. Versions before 4.8.11, 4.9.6 and 4.10.2 are vulnerable.
11	CVE-2017-15275	119		Overflow +Info	2017-11-27	2018-10-21	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	None	None	Samba before 4.7.3 might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging failure of the server to clear allocated heap memory.
12	CVE-2017-12163	200		+Info	2018-07-26	2019-10-09	4.8	None	Local Network	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	None	An information leak flaw was found in the way SMB1 protocol was implemented by Samba before 4.4.16, 4.5.x before 4.5.14, and 4.6.x before 4.6.8. A malicious client could use this flaw to dump server memory contents to a file on the samba share or to a shared printer, though the exact area of server memory cannot be controlled by the attacker.
13	CVE-2018-1139	522			2018-08-22	2019-10-09	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	None	None	A flaw was found in the way samba before 4.7.9 and 4.8.4 allowed the use of weak NTLMv1 authentication even when NTLMv1 was explicitly disabled. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to read the credential and other details passed between the samba server and client.
14	CVE-2016-2126	264			2017-05-11	2018-05-10	4.0	None	Remote	Low	Single system	None	None	Partial	Samba version 4.0.0 up to 4.5.2 is vulnerable to privilege elevation due to incorrect handling of the PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) checksum. A remote, authenticated, attacker can cause the winbindd process to crash using a legitimate Kerberos ticket. A local service with access to the winbindd privileged pipe can cause winbindd to cache elevated access permissions.
15	CVE-2018-10919	200		+Info	2018-08-22	2019-10-09	4.0	None	Remote	Low	Single system	Partial	None	None	The Samba Active Directory LDAP server was vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw because of missing access control checks. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to extract confidential attribute values using LDAP search expressions. Samba versions before 4.6.16, 4.7.9 and 4.8.4 are vulnerable.
16	CVE-2018-14629	835		DoS	2018-11-28	2019-10-09	4.0	None	Remote	Low	Single system	None	None	Partial	A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in Samba's LDAP server before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, and 4.9.3. A CNAME loop could lead to infinite recursion in the server. An unprivileged local attacker could create such an entry, leading to denial of service.
17	CVE-2018-16841	415		DoS Mem. Corr.	2018-11-28	2019-10-09	4.0	None	Remote	Low	Single system	None	None	Partial	Samba from version 4.3.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 are vulnerable to a denial of service. When configured to accept smart-card authentication, Samba's KDC will call talloc_free() twice on the same memory if the principal in a validly signed certificate does not match the principal in the AS-REQ. This is only possible after authentication with a trusted certificate. talloc is robust against further corruption from a double-free with talloc_free() and directly calls abort(), terminating the KDC process.
18	CVE-2018-16851	476		DoS	2018-11-28	2019-10-09	4.0	None	Remote	Low	Single system	None	None	Partial	Samba from version 4.0.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, 4.9.3 is vulnerable to a denial of service. During the processing of an LDAP search before Samba's AD DC returns the LDAP entries to the client, the entries are cached in a single memory object with a maximum size of 256MB. When this size is reached, the Samba process providing the LDAP service will follow the NULL pointer, terminating the process. There is no further vulnerability associated with this issue, merely a denial of service.
19	CVE-2019-3824	275		DoS	2019-03-06	2019-04-05	4.0	None	Remote	Low	Single system	None	None	Partial	A flaw was found in the way an LDAP search expression could crash the shared LDAP server process of a samba AD DC in samba before version 4.10. An authenticated user, having read permissions on the LDAP server, could use this flaw to cause denial of service.
20	CVE-2016-2125	20			2018-10-31	2019-10-09	3.3	None	Local Network	Low	Not required	Partial	None	None	It was found that Samba before versions 4.5.3, 4.4.8, 4.3.13 always requested forwardable tickets when using Kerberos authentication. A service to which Samba authenticated using Kerberos could subsequently use the ticket to impersonate Samba to other services or domain users.
21	CVE-2018-1050	20		DoS	2018-03-13	2019-04-09	2.9	None	Local Network	Medium	Not required	None	None	Partial	All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to a denial of service attack when the RPC spoolss service is configured to be run as an external daemon. Missing input sanitization checks on some of the input parameters to spoolss RPC calls could cause the print spooler service to crash.
